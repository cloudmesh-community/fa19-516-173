### Solar Energy
Solar Energy is energy generated by sun light using PhotoVoltic cells. This is existing from past decaades but recently its becoming lt popular with advancent in power generation and cost reduction. 

Few data centers that using solor energy.
* Emerson Network Power (Missouri)
* i/o Data Centers (Arizona)
* Sonoma Mountain Data Center (California)
* Intel (New Mexico)
* WorldBackups.net (United Kingdom)

### TESLA 
Its difficult to find renewable enthuist who have not heard about Tesla. TESLA is the company which strived for Electric Vehicle (EV) introduction and now a world leader in making best EVs which are not reliable but also environment friendly and and highly efficient. If someone ask you what is Tesla, you can answer with any or all of these
* Solar Company
* EV car company
* Software Company
* Energy Storage Company
* Battery Company

There end to end offering enables you to go off grid or part of it. With solar Pannels/Tiles one can generate electricy and can also store it in Tesla Wall (Battery) , Use that electricty for house hold work , or charge Electric Car. Goverment across world understand the impact EVs vehicles can make and encouraging end users to adapt them.

## E.Datacenter.7:
This article summarizies well the leaps already made to conserve world's power used to data center especially the component that is used to cool down or do other activities that are non core. This is measured by PUE (Power usage efficiency) and various techniques are used to achive the good efficiency. Even the small unnessary component like video connectors, blinking ligts can result in considerable savings over a peroid of time in data centers. This has resulted in PUE from 2 to almost towards 1.12. Hyperscale datacenters are not only ore efficient in terms of processing but also very efficient in terms of operational costs. Currently it seems it will be really difficult to go further on make things more efficients but with new technology advancements things can ne improved further. Artifical intellagence and diverting heat generated for other essential usage gives some hope.
